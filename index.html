      <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
      <p>
        I am Sathish Kumar, a dedicated Engineering Student with passion for coding and learning new stuffs. I am studying computer science at <a href="http://binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University</a> in New York.
        I did my Summer 2017 Software Engineer Internship in <a href="http://www.telenav.com/"> Telenav Inc</a> in SantaClara, California. I also have 2+ years of Work Experience in <a href="https://www.lntinfotech.com/en-US/Pages/Home.aspx"> L&T Infotech</a> Chennai, India. You can contact me at <a href= "mailto:sathish_kumar_93@yahoo.com">sathish_kumar_93@yahoo.com</a>. I always believe that people can gain knowledge by getting to know how a 3rd person would approach a problem. This new perspective might come in handy for us in some other situation.

        I'm a fan of Android and Linux. I have HTC one M9 running on stock Android 7.0 (Nougat). My laptop is running in Linux Mint and Windows 10. I try to host most of my code
        and configurations on my <a href="https://github.com/sathish1993/">GitHub</a>. For editing text, I use <span>vim</span> and <span>Sublime Text</span>. I had used <span>SVN</span> in my Office and now I am using <span>Git</span> for version control on all of my projects. I prefer to use Java and Python for most of my programming, although I have plenty of experience with  C, CPP, and JavaScript. I am also proficient in SQL, NoSQL, HTML5 and CSS3 and have basic nderstanding of Functional Programming languages like Scheme, Haskell and Erlang. 
	      Lot of free time goes into playing Fifa in my PS4 and learning new ideas.
