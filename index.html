      <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
      <p>
        I am Sathish Kumar, a dedicated Engineering Student with passion for coding and learning new stuffs. I am studying computer science at <a href="http://binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University</a> in New York.
        I also have 2+ years of Work Experience in <a href="https://www.lntinfotech.com/en-US/Pages/Home.aspx"> L&T Infotech</a> Chennai, India. You can contact me at
        <a href= "mailto:sathish_kumar_93@yahoo.com">sathish_kumar_93@yahoo.com</a> and I always believe that people
        can learn by seeing what others do and by replicating it, people can gain more knowledge.

        I'm a fan of Android and Linux. I have HTC one M9 running on stock Android 7.0 (Nougat). My laptop is running in Linux Mint 18 Sarah. I try to host most of my code
        and configurations on my <a href="https://github.com/sathish1993/">GitHub</a>. For editing text of any sort, I use <span>vim</span>. I had used <span>SVN</span> in my Office and now I am using <span>Git</span>
        for version control on all of my projects.I prefer to use Java for most of my programming, although I have plenty of experience with C, CPP, and JavaScript. I am also
        proficient in SQL, HTML5 and CSS3 and have basic understanding of Functional Programming languages like Scheme, Haskell and Erlang. Currently started to learn Python.
        Lot of free time goes into learning Algorithms and web programming.
